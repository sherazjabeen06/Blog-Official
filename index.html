                        BuzzFeed is a trendy news blog that targets millennials. Focusing on social news and entertainment, the secret of BuzzFeed's success has a lot to do with the image-heavy listicles published on their platform and end up often going viral. Though founded in 2006, BuzzFeed really took off as a brand and news blog of its own in 2011 when it started publishing serious news and long-form journalism on topics like technology, business, politics, and more.
